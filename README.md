I've created a comprehensive personal budgeting web application using React and TypeScript, based on the Vite template. Here's a summary of what has been implemented:

    Project Structure: The application is organized into components, each handling a specific feature of the budgeting app.

    Routing: React Router is used to navigate between different sections of the app.

    Dashboard: Displays a summary of total income, expenses, and current balance. It includes pie and bar charts for visualizing expense breakdowns and income vs. expenses.

    Transaction Form: Allows users to add new income or expense entries with fields for amount, category, date, notes, and payment method.

    Categories: Users can view, add, and remove expense categories.

    Reports: Provides weekly and monthly reports with bar charts and tabular data for income vs. expenses.

    Budget Goals: Allows setting and tracking budget limits for different categories, with a pie chart for visualization.

    Authentication: Basic login and registration forms are included.

    Responsive Design: The app uses Tailwind CSS for a responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

    Charts: Recharts library is used for creating interactive and responsive charts.

I've set up the basic backend structure with Express and MongoDB, implemented user authentication, and added state management using React Context. Here's a summary of the changes:

    Backend Setup:
        Created a server folder with Express setup, MongoDB connection, and basic route structure.
        Implemented user authentication with registration and login routes.
        Added a middleware for protecting routes that require authentication.

    Frontend Changes:
        Added AuthContext for managing authentication state.
        Updated Login and Register components to interact with the backend API.
        Implemented PrivateRoute component to protect authenticated routes.

    Package Updates:
        Added necessary backend dependencies (express, mongoose, jsonwebtoken, etc.).
        Updated scripts to run both frontend and backend concurrently during development.

To run the application, you'll need to:

    Start a MongoDB instance locally or update the MONGODB_URI in the .env file to point to your MongoDB instance.
    Run npm run dev to start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.
